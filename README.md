# HOW DOES IT WORK
> Access main hub
  > If you are in possession of an up to date database, upload it
    > Choose Log in or Sign Up
  > If not
    > Register a new account to start a fresh database

> When signed in
  > Read the article on how to software engineer, choose a project to develop
  > Play my game

> The game
  > Use WASD and Space, collect diamonds to get powerups and up the score
  > The more diamonds collected the higher the score
  > Check your score against others

# JSON
> I used a local storage JSON solution
  > It is Offline and stored on your local machine
  > Upload the database file that comes with the project to the website on the main menu
  > Now the website can use the JSON file to check for registered users or to register users and their game score
  > Once logged in the website will automatically download a JSON file, that one stores previous data as well as the record about the newest registered user.
  > Use the most up to date file to upload the next time you visit the site, this is how I came up with my database solution. 

# POSSIBLE ISSUES
> When testing my website
  > Some special characters are not allowed, 1 working special character example is "?"
